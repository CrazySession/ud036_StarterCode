# ud036_StarterCode ---- Student Project CrazySession
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

Hello and welcome to CrazySessions Movie Website Database.

#   How to run the code with an ide

1.  Download the code or clone the repository
2.  Open it with an ide of your choice (e.g. sublime, pycharm, atom)
3.  Start the program to run the website from the entertainment_center.py file
    if you try to start the program from another file, you will get a console
    message which will lead you to the right file, hopefully

#   How to run the code from the command prompt

1.  Go to the folder you downloaded the repository to
    (e.g. in my case E:\PythonProjects\ud036_StarterCode)
2.  Shift + right click -- chose "Open Command prompt here"
3.  write "python entertainment_center.py" in the command prompt
    and enjoy the program
    same as in the ide if you try to start from another file you
    will get an error message with a note to the correct file
